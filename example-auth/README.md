The index.html in the public folder is a template that will be processed with [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin). See more at [Vue CLI Guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/html-and-static-assets.html#html) about HTML in Vue.

The src/main.js is the one that runs and renders the struture to '.vue' files.
